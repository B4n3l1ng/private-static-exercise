      <h3>Iteration 1: Rocket</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a <span>Rocket</span> class.</li>
        <li>Add a public property <span>name</span> (from constructor argument).</li>
        <li>Add a private property <span>#fuel</span> (initialized to 100).</li>
        <li>Add a private method <span>#burnFuel(amount)</span> to decrease fuel.</li>
        <li>
          Add a public method <span>launch()</span> that checks fuel before launching. The rocket should only launch, if it has at least 50 fuel.
          Launching should burnFuel by 50. Depending on the success of failure, should return a string with the shape: "{NAME} has launched into
          space." or "{NAME} cannot launch due to low fuel"
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div>
      <h3>Iteration 2: Mission Control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a <span>MissionControl</span> class with a static property <span>rocketsLaunched.</span> Initialize it as 0.</li>
        <li>
          Add a static method <span>registerLaunch(rocket)</span> to launch rockets. It should receive the rocket object as an argument, call the
          <span>launch()</span> method of the rocket object, saving the return in a message variable, log it, and increment the
          <span>rocketsLaunched</span> static property, if the launch was successful.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Iteration 3: Running the Simulation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create two <span>Rocket</span> objects.</li>
        <li>Call <span>MissionControl.registerLaunch()</span> for each rocket.</li>
        <li>Try launching a rocket again to check fuel behavior.</li>
        <li>
          Log the total launches using
          <span>MissionControl.rocketsLaunched</span>.
        </li>
